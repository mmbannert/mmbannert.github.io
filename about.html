## About

Hi! I'm a cognitive neuroscientist working as a postdoc at the
<a href="https://www.cin.uni-tuebingen.de/" target="_blank">Werner Reichardt
  Centre for Integrative Neuroscience</a> and the
<a href="https://ps.is.tuebingen.mpg.de/" target="_blank">Max Planck Institute
  for Intelligent Systems</a>
in TÃ¼bingen. The aim of my research is to understand how
our brains enable us to perceive and make correct inferences about our
surroundings given the very limited information that is available to our senses.

I use modern neuroimaging techniques and psychophysical modeling to understand
the complex relationships between brain, mind, and the outside world. To
address my research questions, I have been using color vision as a model system
as well as motion processing.

More recently, I became became interested in computer vision. The fascinating
progress in artificial intelligence raises the question how comparisons between
biological and artificial cognitive systems (i.e., brains and machines) can
enhance our understanding of the human mind and behavior.

<!-- Github's Octocat was designed by Simon Oxley, alongside the white bird Twitter used (before they received a proper logo) as part of a usual routine of cranking out images for iStock. GitHub saw it, and wanted it, presumably under the notion that it can represent how complex code combines to create peculiar things, much like the octopuss... except the CEO of GitHub called it an octocat, and it has been the octocat since <a href="https://www.quora.com/GitHub/What-is-the-story-behind-GitHub%E2%80%99s-octocat-mascot" target="_blank">[via]</a>.

Octocat is Github's logo and trademark and here is used to illustrate a fictional character (John Smith) that used the *{ Personal }* Jekyll Theme to build his website.
